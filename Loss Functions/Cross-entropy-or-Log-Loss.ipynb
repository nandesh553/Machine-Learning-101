    "# Cross Entropy or Log Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross Entrop Loss is used to measure the performance of a classification models whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1 where high.\n",
    "\n",
    "It generally calculating the difference between **two probability distributions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-entropy loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. So predicting a probability of .012 when the actual observation label is 1 would be bad and result in a high loss value. A perfect model would have a log loss of 0.\n",
